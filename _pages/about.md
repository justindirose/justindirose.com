Hey. I’m Justin.

I’ve been around productivity and leadership for a number of years, but I only feel like I’m just starting to figure it out. In writing this site, I want to show you some things that have helped me, stuff I think is cool, and encourage you in the pursuit of discovering who you really are.

You might see posts centered around leadership, technology, productivity, or even coffee, Star Wars, and nerdy keyboards.

I’m not a big fan of advertisements, so you likely won’t find those here. But you may see affiliate links. It’s one way you can help support me making content valuable to you.

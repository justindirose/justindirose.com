## Bio

Justin grew up in the plains of the Midwest, then decided to move to the forest, where things are a little bit more green and a lot colder (but less windy). After a near decade-long run in the technology services industry, Justin struck it out on his own to pursue further work on the web, as well as spend more time with his family. Speaking of family, Justin is married to the beautiful Ruth, and has two wonderful children. In his free time, Justin is a songwriter and musician. According to his son, he makes pretty good pancakes, too.

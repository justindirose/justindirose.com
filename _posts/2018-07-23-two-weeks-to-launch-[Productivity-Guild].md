> The last four weeks have been an exercise in mental health. I’ll be honest — I really love my current job. My team is fantastic, my boss is a great mentor, and the company has been really flexible. There’s been a real up and down cycle of excitement and deep sadness throughout the process of leaving.

I’m documenting my journey into free agency starting this week over on the [Productivity Guild](https://productivityguild.com). I’d love for you to follow along.

Iâ€™ve had a dream on my heart for a number of years, and itâ€™s finally coming true. Iâ€™m becoming a free agent. 

Yes, indeed itâ€™s true. August 3rd is my last day working for my current employer, and Iâ€™m off to make it being self-employed! It is a bit of a crazy story, but Iâ€™ll do my best to share it. 

Iâ€™ve had a long-standing passion for the web and its many facets and uses, starting in middle school playing online games against friends, all the way into computers, networking, and development, which I got my Bachelors in. 

Upon graduation from college, I moved to Bemidji, MN at the height of the Great Recession, so jobs were lacking. Additionally, the tech scene in Bemidji wasnâ€™t all that hopping at the time. Itâ€™s a pretty small, rural town, so itâ€™s a little behind the cutting edge. Thankfully, I eventually found a job in IT, which led me to where I am today. 

My wife and I have two kids â€” a 2.5 year old and a 5 month old. Itâ€™s been a blessing to have my wife on maternity leave for a long period, but that must end ðŸ˜¢. She had some training to complete, so we had to send our 5mo old to daycare. As a result, we lost our spot in daycare altogether (long story), which threw us for a loop. 

Meanwhile, I had been doing some side work as a developer for a friend of mine. We had been messaging back and forth, and turns out he could bring me on to do long term contract development work for exactly what I needed! ðŸ™Œ

So thus began the long venture of asking, re-asking, and asking again the big question â€” can we really make this work?

I spent probably a week in a large mindmap trying to vet out all the possibilities and questions Iâ€™d need answers to. Lo and behold, the answer was yes. 

It couldnâ€™t have been more perfect â€” the right opportunity at the right time, a person to backfill my position easily at my current job, and a dream in my heart about to be fulfilled. 

Iâ€™m currently at [Macstock](http://macstockconferenceandexpo.com), excited to introduce myself for the first time to new people as an entrepreneur.

If youâ€™re now a free agent, or are going on the journey yourself like I am, hit me up. Iâ€™d be glad to hear from you. 

In the words of Leeroy Jenkins (Iâ€™m dating myself here) â€” letâ€™s do this!

title: Free Agent Journal - Week 4 - Break Yourself, Not Focus [Productivity Guild]
---

Working from home or on your own can cause a lot of challenges to your focus. In this week’s Free Agent Journal, I discuss how I’m staying focus, (not) taking breaks, and wishing I had more time for hobbies.

If you're a free agent, or wish you were one, I'd love to hear from you. Feel free to join the discussion on the [Guild](https://productivityguild.com) or send me a message!

Today is Christmas, and in the spirit of the season, I've been working on a gift for all of you.

Below is a **free download** for my new acoustic single titled "Peaceful Steps".

This one's been sitting on the shelf for a couple of years, and I now felt it was time to release it. Shortly it will be available on all major music distribution platforms as well.

Enjoy!

If I could describe 2017 in one word, it would be “transition.” 

I changed jobs, moved churches, and found out my wife and I are having a second child.

It’s interesting as my one word for the year was “surrender.” I’ve had to do a lot of surrendering this year — my own plans, ambitions, ideas of how things would go.  Everything’s changed and I’m okay with that.

## Accomplishments
* Wrote, recorded, mixed, mastered, and released my first song - “Mirrors”
* Improved my ability to confront people in healthier ways
* Learned a *lot* about how to effectively manage people (thanks [Manager Tools](http://manager-tools.com))
* Iterated, iterated, and iterated again on my own ability to intentionally accomplish goals
* Landed my first two side web development clients, and, subsequently, learned a lot about running a business

## Things I Learned
I spent some time reviewing my journal this week. It’s not a practice I typically engage in, though I’ve heard it is helpful to do so. I noticed a few themes I learned over the year. 

1. Don’t engage the political battle in your workplace. Recognize it, but **cut your own path by genuinely caring for people.**
2. Want to see change? **Give and seek consistent, quality feedback** with those around you.
3. If you’re in a new position or environment, seek to understand it, then **start building processes to improve and maintain** your desired end result.
4. **Find out how you work best and do that**, not just what other people say works for them.
5. **Investing in proper ergonomics is worth it**, especially if you primarily work on a computer.
6. **Surround yourself with people “cut from the same cloth.”** It’s essential to gaining forward momentum.
7. **Position your heart attitude for the day**; it will determine the outcome of your day every time.
8. **Life is an iterative journey.** Don’t think you have to have it all figured out on day one. Start and improve from there.
9. As a parent and spouse, **intentionality is critical.** Intentional time, words, responses, often thought through ahead of time instead of just in the moment.
